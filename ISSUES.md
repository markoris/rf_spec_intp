- implement preprocessing, evaluation, etc.
	- change inputs to be interpolated in log-mass, switch back for evaluation
- move docstring from init to relevant functions
- need to add time as an interpolation variable
- this just uses random forest for now, should make generally applicable
	- write interpolators.py from interpolators_v2.py and update it to be better 
- get tmax for spectra from hdf5 filename? good solution? fine for now.
- get git-lfs installed and use it for this datafile
